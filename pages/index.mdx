# Introduction

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) in 2020 is very different from ReactJS of only a few years ago. As the library has matured so have the techniques and additional libraries that can be used with ReactJS e.g. [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and easy ways to host a ReactJS application rapidly e.g. [Netlify]() and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

The future looks even brighter with the likes of [Strapi](https://strapi.io), [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com) and [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) bringing fast ways to completely scafold out an entire application much like [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

As a way to upskill and take notes with my ongoing learning of ReactJS and the entire ecosystem this is my own personal wiki/documentation site that I can easily access and share. I hope that others find it useful on their own journey learning ReactJS.
