# State Reducers

A reducer is a function which takes two arguments -- the current state and an action -- and returns based on both arguments a new state. In a pseudo function it could be expressed as:

```js
(state, action) => newState
```

As example, it would look like the following in JavaScript for the scenario of increasing a number by one:

```js
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  return state + 1;
}
```

In this case, the current state is an integer (e.g. count) and the reducer function increases the count by one. If we would rename the argument state to count, it may be more readable and approachable by newcomers to this concept. However, keep in mind that the count is still the state:

```js
const counterReducer = (count, action) => {
  return count + 1;
};
```

The reducer function is a pure function without any side-effects, which means that given the same input (e.g. state and action), the expected output (e.g. newState) will always be the same. This makes reducer functions the perfect fit for reasoning about state changes and testing them in isolation. You can repeat the same test with the same input as arguments and always expect the same output:

```js
expect(counterReducer(0)).to.equal(1); // successful test
expect(counterReducer(0)).to.equal(1); // successful test
```

That's the essence of a reducer function. However, we didn't touch the second argument of a reducer yet: the action. The action is normally defined as an object with a type property. Based on the type of the action, the reducer can perform conditional state transitions:

```js
const counterReducer = (count, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'INCREASE') {
    return count + 1;
  }
 
  if (action.type === 'DECREASE') {
    return count - 1;
  }
 
  return count;
};
```

If the action type doesn't match any condition, we return the unchanged state. Testing a reducer function with multiple state transitions -- given the same input, it will always return the same expected output -- still holds true as mentioned before which is demonstrated in the following test cases:

```js
// successful tests
// because given the same input we can always expect the same output
expect(counterReducer(0, { type: 'INCREASE' })).to.equal(1);
expect(counterReducer(0, { type: 'INCREASE' })).to.equal(1);
 
// other state transition
expect(counterReducer(0, { type: 'DECREASE' })).to.equal(-1);
 
// if an unmatching action type is defined the current state is returned
expect(counterReducer(0, { type: 'UNMATCHING_ACTION' })).to.equal(0);
```
However, more likely you will see a switch case statement in favor of if else statements in order to map multiple state transitions for a reducer function. The following reducer performs the same logic as before but expressed with a switch case statement:

```js
const counterReducer = (count, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      return count + 1;
    case 'DECREASE':
      return count - 1;
    default:
      return count;
  }
};
```

In this scenario, the count itself is the state on which we are applying our state changes upon by increasing or decreasing the count. However, often you will not have a JavaScript primitive (e.g. integer for count) as state, but a complex JavaScript object. For instance, the count could be one property of our state object:

```js
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Don't worry if you don't understand immediately what's happening in the code here. Foremost, there are two important things to understand in general:

- **The state processed by a reducer function is immutable.** That means the incoming state -- coming in as argument -- is never directly changed. Therefore the reducer function always has to return a new state object. If you haven't heard about immutability, you may want to check out the topic immutable data structures.

- Since we know about the state being a immutable data structure, we can use the JavaScript spread operator **to create a new state object from the incoming state and the part we want to change** (e.g. count property). This way we ensure that the other properties that aren't touch from the incoming state object are still kept intact for the new state object.
