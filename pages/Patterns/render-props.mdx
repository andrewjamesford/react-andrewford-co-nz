# Render props 

Render props are a prop that you pass to a component telling it what to render. Your not passing a component instead we are passing a function to render a component.

> A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.


```js

<FetchWeather render={({ weatherForcast, onRequest }) => (
  <WeatherForcast weatherForcast={weatherForcast} onRequest={onRequest} />
)} />

```

While a simple pattern this can be powerful. As the render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know **what** to render.

Inside the FetchWeather component, we pass a prop called render, which is going to be a function to render our WeatherForcast component. That render function takes two arguments - `weatherForcast` which is going to be our weather forecast that we fetch from the API, and onRequest which is our function that we're going to use to make a new request every time we click a button.

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div onClick={this.onRequest}>
      {this.props.render(this.state)}
    </div>
  )
}
```
