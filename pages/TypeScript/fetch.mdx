# Fetch with TypeScript

Here's how to use Fetch with TypeScript

```typescript
const fetchProducts = async () => {
  // You could return an environment variable here
  const host = "http://localhost:3000";
  // Make a fetch request
  const response = await fetch(`${host}/api/products`);
  // Return the result as JSON
  const result = await response.json();
  return result;
};
```
