# Great guide types vs. interface

Check out this great guide on [types vs interface](https://blog.logrocket.com/types-vs-interfaces-in-typescript/)

## What should you use

> Interfaces are better when you need to define a new object or method of an object. For example, in React applications, when you need to define the props that a specific component is going to receive, it’s ideal to use interface over types

```typescript
interface TodoProps {
  name: string;
  isCompleted: boolean
};

const Todo: React.FC<TodoProps> = ({ name, isCompleted }) => {
  ...
};
```

> Types are better when you need to create functions, for example. Let’s imagine that we have a function that’s going to return an object called, type alias is more recommended for this approach:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string,
  age: number
};

type ReturnPerson = (
  person: Person
) => Person;

const returnPerson: ReturnPerson = (person) => {
  return person;
};
```
